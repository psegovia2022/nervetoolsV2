    <h1>Contributing to the access to science</h1>

    <div class="grouping">
      <p>Nerve Tools is an open-source project that aims to democratize access to science. The ultimate goal is to assist scientists and enthusiast students, especially in undeveloped countries, to build and design bioinstruments if needed.</p>
      <p>Our philosophy is to share for free the tools developed by Dr. Marcelo Aguilar-Rivera after they have been published.</p>

        <p>This is an amplifier system for 64 chs based on INTAN technology. The footprint of the first board version (V1) is 12 mm x 18 mm x 4 mm, including chips and connectors. We are working on a second version (V2) that should be smaller than V1. This system got rid of the Omnetics connectors cutting down the bill expenses. An INTAN cable, after been cut in half, can be soldered directly to the twelve pads array as in V2, contributing to reduce the cost. Optionally, researchers can choose the V1 that uses a 12-pin Omnetics PZN-12-AA conector for more versatility. Both versions of this Tiny HS can be interfaced with INTAN RHD controllers. </p>

      <h1>Diversity, Equity and Inclusion</h1>
      <p>At Nerve Tools, we believe in Science, Love is love, Black Lives Matter, and Feminism is for everyone. </p>
    
      <p>  Equity aims to identify and eliminate barriers that prevent the participation of some groups. Thus, as scientists and citizens, we are responsible for creating awareness about the data on discrimination and its negative impacts in our scientific community and society. As teachers and mentors, we are committed to encouraging students to embrace diversity, creating an inclusive work environment.</p>
